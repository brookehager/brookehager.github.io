                <h2>Our favorite looks from the streets of New York</h2>

                <p>
                    Fashion month is officially underway. While we love scoping out the runways for next season’s biggest trends and keeping up with the glam looks at all the after parties, the best sartorial inspiration is often found out
                    in the wild — aka the subway-grated streets of New York City.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, New York is the epicenter of street style, where you’re just as likely to spot haute couture out and about as you are likely to see a head-to-toe vintage ensemble that someone pulled from their grandmother’s
                    closet. This season, our favorite street style looks are a delicate mix of edgy and sophisticated — we’re talking matching skirt suits, vibrant pattern mixing, and teeny tiny purses. Fun as the fashion may be, comfort is
                    actually the true key during these months. Sure, sprinting from one show to the next in five-inch heels looks quite chic, but it’s far from practical. Fortunately, the sneakers-with-everything trend continues to dominate
                    the scene, so the streets saw an abundance of distance-friendly footwear. Other low-maintenance favorites included bucket hats, belt bags, and Palazzo pants.

                    We're all leaning into low-key, casual dressing these days and come fall, we're predicting the vibe will still be the same. From elevated legging looks to comfy knitted dresses you can wear both inside and out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take your legging looks to a whole new level by opting for a trendy split hem pair that feels especially fresh. Throw on an oversize blazer for an instant polish. Extend the shelf-life of your billowy sundresses by
                    wearing them crisp white sneakers and even boots into fall. If you do wear jeans, make this casual formula your new go-to. Wear loose-fitting or wide-leg denim with a basic tank, tee, or bodysuit and top it off with a
                    blazer and flats. It's simple, but looks so chic. Just because we're no longer wearing sweats 24/7 doesn't mean we're ditching them completely, either. In fact, I think it's given us a newfound appreciation for a
                    matching set in a pretty color. Wear one with tall socks and throwback sneakers for the ultimate cozy-cool vibe
                </p>

                <p>
                    Knit dresses are another trend that's deceivingly comfortable and easily dressed up or down—it all depends on the shoes and accessories. Slip dresses rose to a new level of popularity this summer, so we predict that
                    fashion girls will keep wearing them into fall with the addition of a cute cardigan thrown over. If you wore the shacket trend last fall, well, congrats, because it's not going anywhere. Look for one that's printed or in
                    a non-neutral color and style it unbuttoned over a monochrome base.

                    This season is leather weather, no doubt about it. Leather trench coats, blazers, and more are set to be the outerwear of choice among the stylish New York City set. To give loafers (and other flat shoes) a quirky-cool
                    update, simply style them with tall socks. Bonus points if your socks come in an eye-catching color or a pretty print. Walking all day is just part of life in New York City, which makes narrowing in on sandals that are
                    both cute and comfy essential. The leather jacket is, to me, synonymous with that sleek and polished look NY people are known for, and while leather motos will always be a thing, fresher leather jackets like blazers and
                    shirt jackets are coming in hot.

                    We've hit the home stretch of New York Fashion Week, and the street style crowd is still giving us a ton of fashion hits. On Tuesday, cool puffers were among some of our favorite looks, from trippy prints to interesting
                    materials. Usually, we turn to a staple color (read: safe) for this type of outerwear, like black or army green. But where's the fun in that? We love how showgoers opted to turn this classic garment on its head, with
                    cropped silhouettes, floral prints, denim details, and more.

                            Wardrobes can be stressful affairs. It's easy to feel like you never have anything to wear. That's why it's so important to dedicate some time to going through the clothes have hanging up or stuffed in the back
                            of drawers and see what you actually use.
